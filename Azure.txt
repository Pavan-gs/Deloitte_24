Azure Storage
============
paas
Managed cloud storage service --> highly available, durable, scalable & redundant sorage
Files, Messages, Tables, discs

1 subscription --> 100 accounts --> 1 account * 500 tb

3 categories

1. Storage for virtual machienes (disks, files)
2. Unstructured data (video, audio, images, messages, text) --> blobs and datalake stores
3. Structured (Like no sql db tables, sql db, cosmos db)

Blob storage --> Object storage --> Binary, text, image, video, audio data, data for back up, disaster recovery etc.

Files --> Highly available network file shares, uses SMB (Standard server message block) protocol (migration)

Tables --> Structured nosql data in cloud ---> Key & value pair --> Schemaless design

Queues --> Store and retrieve messages --> 64 kb 

Standard --> Backed up by HDD (magnetic drives), Lowest cost per GB, Best for apps that needs bulk storage, data accessing is infrequent

Premium --> SDD (Solid state drives), low latency performance, best for intense i/o like d/b's

General purpose v2 --> Blob, Tables, Queues, Files
Blob --> Block blob, page blob, File shares

Performance Tiers
-=============-
Hot --> Store data that is accessed frequently (Highest storage cost, lowest read cost)
cool --> Infrequent data access (atleast 30 days) --> Storage cost is less, read cost is more
Cold --> Atleast 90 days
Archive --> rare data access (15-99 yrs/ atleast 180 days) --> Lowest cost, read cost is highest 

Blob containers & categories
========================
Containers --> Multiple blobs under a container, Unstructured data  

Block blob ->> Any video, audio, image files

Page blob --> random access files upto 8 tb --> virtual hard drive (vhd) and serves as a disk for vm

Append blob --> blocl blob but optimized for append operations (log data from vm)

Storage replications
--==============--
LRS --> 3 copies of data in 3 storage boxes within same data center
ZRS --> 3 copies of data in multiple data centers within same region
GRS --> 3 copies of data in primary region, and 3 copies in a secondary geo location --> 6 copies
RA-GRS --> GRS with read only access to secondary data center
GZRS -->  3 copies of data in 3 highly available primary zone using ZRS and 3 copies in secondary region
RA-GZRS --> Read only GZRS

Azure Datalake storage (Gen 2)
==========================

Data lake --> Hadoop compatible, Optimizer drivers
Blob storage --> Low cost, Storage tiers (Hot, cold, cool, Archive), High availability & disaster recovery

Datalake Gen2 vs Blob
==================

Access tiers --> both
Top level Organisation --> both (containers)
Lower level organisation --> blob (virtual directory), Datalake Gen2 (Directory)
Data container --> Blob, File

Data Lake doesn't provide --> soft delete, static website, Snapshots, Immutable storage
Blob doesn't provide --> Access Control Lists

{
"name":"fsd",
"sal":4324,
"city:"hjvkds"
}

Spark (processing)
Pipelines (Integration) --> ETL/ELT (ADF)

Integration with Cosmos DB, ML, Power BI

Synapse Workspace
================
To build cloud based enterprise analytics solutions

Attached with ADLS Gen2 and File system

SQL --> SQL pool--> Helps you run t-sql scripts on data in linked services

Serverless --> built-in --> use sql without reserving capacity.
Billing is based on the amount of data processed to run the query

Openrowset --> Allows you to access files in Az storage and return the content as a set of rows

Dedicated sql pool --> Consumes billable resources if it's active, pause the pool to reduce the costs
and this is associated with a dedicated sql db.

Data Explorer pools --> Data Explorer pools can be used to run near real-time analytics on large volumes of logs and time series data streaming from applications, websites, IoT devices, and more. 

Spark pool
=========
Notebook  --> Python, Scala, Pyspark,C#, sql, R
Spark job definitions --> To run batch spark jobs using jar files 

Linked Services
=============
Connection string that defines the connection information needed for the workspace to connect to external resources.

Pipelines
========
To move data between services & orchestrate activities

Logical grouping of activities that performs a task together
Activities defines actions within pipelines --> copying data, running notebook or a sql/spark program
