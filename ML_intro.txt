Machine Learning
===============

Supervised Learning   --> Predictive models
Unsupervised Learning --> Grouping data based on similarities

Predictive models
===============
Independent variables / Predictor variables / Input variables --> X
Target Variable/Dependent / Y / Op variable --> Y

Mathematical / Statistical relationship between all the x and Y variable

Linear models   --> Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Polinomial linear regression
Non-linear models --> Squared,exponential, logarithmic, square root (linear regression), Decision Tree, SVM, KNN
Ensemble models --> Bagging (RF), Boosting --> ADA, GB, XGboost

Target Variables --> Continuous , Discrete

Steps to build a predictive model
===========================
EDA & Cleaning
BI

Decide the Target Variable
Distribution of Y variable
Split the data --> training, testing
Build the model
Look at the model's stats
testing
evaluate

Data preparations
===============
Data transformations --> Standardization, Normalization
Feature Selection --> P-value, RFE, AUC-ROCR
Sampling --> K-fold CV
Class imbalance --> Over sampling, Under sampling, SMOTE
