/* 1) How many unique departments have employees currently working in them?

2)	For employees who quit the organization, find out how many years the employees were employed. 
Assume that the year consists of 365.25 days. 
Also retrieve the EMPLOYEE_ID, JOB_ID, START_DATE, and END_DATE for these employees 

3)	Query the JOBS table and return a single expression of the form The Job Id for the <job_title’s> job is: <job_id>. 
Take note that the job_title should have an apostrophe and an “s” appended to it to read more naturally. 
A sample of this output for the organization president is: “The Job Id for the President’s job is: AD_PRES.” 
Alias this column expression as “Job Description” using the AS keyword.  */

/* 1. RETRIEVE A LIST OF DEPARTMENT NAMES THAT ENDS WITH "ING" AND SECOND CHARACTER IS "A"

2. Write a query that extracts the JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY, and MAX_SALARY columns, 
as well as an expression called VARIANCE, which is the difference between the MAX_SALARY and MIN_SALARY values, 
for each row. The result should include only JOB_TITLE values that contain either the word “President” or “Manager.” 
Sort the list in descending order based on the VARIANCE expression. If more than one row has the same VARIANCE value, then, 
sort these rows by JOB_TITLE in reverse alphabetic order. 

3) A common computation performed by the Finance department relates to the calculation of taxes levied upon an employee. 
The tax deducted per employee is calculated by obtaining the annual salary for the employee and the current tax rate, 
which may vary from year to year as per the regulations laid from the ministry of finance. 
Write a reusable query for the current tax rate and for an employee_id as input, return the EMPLOYEE_ID, 
FIRST_NAME, SALARY, ANNUAL SALARY,TAX_RATE, and the TAX AMOUNT */

/* 
1. Print the hire date in the format "01-Jan-2022"
2. Print last name, hire date in the format, "1st of jan 2022" */

/* 1. Envelope printing restricts the addressee field to 16 characters. Ideally, 
the addressee field contains employees’ FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME values separated by a 
single space. When the combined length of an employee’s FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME exceeds 15 characters, 
the addressee field should contain their formal name. An employee’s formal name is made up of the 
first letter of their FIRST_NAME and the first 14 characters of their LAST_NAME. You are required to retrieve 
a list of FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME values and formal names for employees where the combined length of FIRST_NAME 
and LAST_NAME exceeds 15 characters. 

2. Write a Query that displays the employee number, hire date, number of months employed, six-month review date, 
first Friday after hire date, and the last day of the hire month for all employees 
who have been employed for fewer than 150 months and working for department 50  */


/* ACTIVITIES 

1)	The company is planning a recruitment drive and wants to identify the days of the week on which 20 or more staff members were hired. 
Your report must list the days and the number of employees hired on each of them.

2) Analysis of staff turnover is a common reporting requirement. You are required to create a report containing the number of employees who left their jobs, grouped by the year in which they left. The jobs they performed are also required. 
The results must be sorted in descending order based on the number of employees in each group.
The report must list the year, the JOB_ID, and the number of employees who left a particular job in that year.

3) Calculate the average length of all the country names. Any fractional components must be rounded to the nearest whole number. */
