/* 1) How many unique departments have employees currently working in them?

2)	For employees who quit the organization, find out how many years the employees were employed. 
Assume that the year consists of 365.25 days. 
Also retrieve the EMPLOYEE_ID, JOB_ID, START_DATE, and END_DATE for these employees 

3)	Query the JOBS table and return a single expression of the form The Job Id for the <job_title’s> job is: <job_id>. 
Take note that the job_title should have an apostrophe and an “s” appended to it to read more naturally. 
A sample of this output for the organization president is: “The Job Id for the President’s job is: AD_PRES.” 
Alias this column expression as “Job Description” using the AS keyword.  */
